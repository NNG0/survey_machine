# Each agent is modeled as a function that takes in a request and returns a response.

# The first agent needs to take in the research question for the survey and make a plan for what to do.


# The literature agent needs to

# The output agents need to work tegether to create the final latex product.
# Let's assume they at the very end recieve a list of questions and the type of answer the questioned person can give.


# TODO: Add agent that checks whether the research question is valid and if it can be answered with the given literature.
# TODO: Add agent that checks whether the research question is ethical.


# TODO: Maybe create an agent that can work on the questions.

# TODO: Do we use additional memory for the agents?
